><h1>Hey There! 🙋🏻‍♀️</h1> 

>## My name is Erica and welcome to my Github

What can I tell you about me? I'm a self-confessed technology geek! 👩🏻‍💻 I’m from Argentina 🇦🇷 and living in Spain 🇪🇸. I graduated from Ironhack’s Bootcamp in Web development and I studied JAVA and TypesScript, which has helped me to finally reach my dream career as a software engineer.
